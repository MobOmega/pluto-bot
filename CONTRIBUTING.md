# Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an event pushing for open-source awareness and promoting contributions from everyone!\
This repository is actively taking part in this event, so don't feel afraid to contribute!

If you need ideas, it would be amazing to have a little bit of a command.registry.ts tidy up. Instead of having a big array, each command could be condensed onto a one like .push().\
New ideas are also welcome, for commands or functionality, or even something like syntax.\
I am also actively looking for more documentation, since I barely know my bot. Some commands that need docs are the Lyrics command, and the Suggest commands.\

Thanks so much, and get hacking!
